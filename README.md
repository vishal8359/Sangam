Introduction
Sangam is a comprehensive full-stack community engagement platform designed to bridge gaps within residential societies and empower local businesses. In today's fast-paced world, societies often struggle with disconnected residents and underutilized local resources. Sangam addresses this by providing a centralized digital hub for modern society living, fostering genuine community connections, and boosting the local economy right from your doorstep.

Developed with over 28,000+ lines of code (22,000+ frontend, 6,000+ backend), Sangam aims to revolutionize how societies interact and thrive.

Technologies Used
Sangam is built on a robust MERN stack with additional powerful tools:

Frontend (22,000+ lines of code):

React.js: For building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Material UI: React components for fast and easy web development.

Framer Motion: A production-ready motion library for React.

Socket.io Client: For real-time communication.

Backend (6,000+ lines of code):

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.

Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

Mongoose: MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.

Socket.io: For real-time, bidirectional event-based communication.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure, stateless authentication.

Cloudinary: Cloud-based image and video management.

Multer: Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data (file uploads).

Architecture
Sangam follows a MERN stack architecture, a popular full-stack development approach:

MongoDB: The NoSQL database stores all application data, including user profiles, society details, chat messages, product listings, and more.

Express.js: The backend web application framework handles API requests, routing, and middleware.

React.js: The frontend library builds the interactive user interface, consuming data from the Express.js API.

Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment powers both the Express.js server and the build processes for React.

Real-time features are handled by Socket.io, providing a persistent connection between the client and server for instant updates.

Deployment
The Sangam application is currently deployed and maintained on Render.

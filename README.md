7. Getting Started (For Developers)
To set up Sangam locally for development or contribution:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
MongoDB (local instance or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Installation
Clone the repositories:

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO.git)
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_BACKEND_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_BACKEND_REPO.git)
(Important: Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME, YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO, and YOUR_BACKEND_REPO with your actual GitHub username and repository names.)

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

cd YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO
npm install # or yarn install
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

cd ../YOUR_BACKEND_REPO # Go back one level then into backend
npm install # or yarn install
Running the App
Backend Setup:

Create a .env file in the YOUR_BACKEND_REPO directory.
Add your MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret, Cloudinary credentials, Razorpay keys, and any other necessary environment variables (e.g., for email service if used for approval emails):
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="your_razorpay_key_id"
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="your_razorpay_key_secret"
# EMAIL_SERVICE_USER="your_email_user"
# EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS="your_email_pass"

Start the backend server:
npm start # or node server.js (depending on your entry file)
Frontend Setup:

Create a .env file in the YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO directory.
Add your backend API URL (ensure this matches where your backend is running, e.g., if local http://localhost:5000):
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
Start the frontend development server:
npm start
The app should now be running locally on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified for your frontend).
